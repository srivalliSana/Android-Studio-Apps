## Introduction

This repository showcases Android applications that demonstrate a range of skills, from basic UI components and event handling to more advanced features like calculation functionality and managing activity flows. The projects span from beginner to intermediate levels.

## Projects List

### Hello World (HWD)

A simple **Hello World** application demonstrating the basic structure of an Android app. This is the first project that introduces basic UI and event handling in Android.

- **Features:**
  - Displays "Hello World" message.
  - Introduction to basic `TextView` and `Button`.

- **Technologies:**
  - **Kotlin** for Android development.
  - Basic Android UI elements like `TextView` and `Button`.

- **File Name:** `HWD`

### Simple Form

A basic form where users can input their name and email, then submit the data. This app demonstrates handling form input and displaying results on the screen.

- **Features:**
  - Input fields for name and email.
  - A button that submits the form and displays a message with the entered data.

- **Technologies:**
  - **Kotlin**.
  - **TextInputLayout** and **EditText** for form inputs.
  - **Button** for submission.

- **File Name:** `SimpleForm`

### Simple Calculator

A basic calculator app that performs simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- **Features:**
  - Buttons for digits and operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
  - Displays results in a `TextView`.
  - Simple input validation.

- **Technologies:**
  - **Kotlin**.
  - **Button** and **TextView** for UI.
  - Basic event handling to perform operations.

- **File Name:** `SimpleCalculator`

### Calculator

An advanced version of the basic calculator that includes more complex operations such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and additional features like clear, AC (all-clear), and equal functionality.

- **Features:**
  - Basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
  - Clear and AC buttons to reset input or the entire app.
  - Display results dynamically in a `TextView` after each operation.
  - Handles both simple and complex calculations.

- **Technologies:**
  - **Kotlin**.
  - **Button** and **TextView** for UI.
  - **Event listeners** for handling button clicks and operations.

- **File Name:** `Calculator`

### Activity Functions Flow

A project designed to demonstrate handling activity flows and function calls between multiple activities. This app is useful for understanding Android's **Activity Lifecycle** and managing transitions.

- **Features:**
  - Multiple activities that demonstrate how to pass data between them.
  - Function calls that interact with the UI elements across activities.
  - Basic management of the back stack and activity transitions.

- **Technologies:**
  - **Kotlin**.
  - **Intent** to pass data between activities.
  - **Activity Lifecycle** management.
  - **Button** to trigger actions and navigate through activities.

- **File Name:** `ActivityFunctionsFlow`

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: Primary programming language for Android development.
- **Android UI Elements**: `Button`, `TextView`, `EditText`, `TextInputLayout`.
- **Activity Lifecycle**: Handling transitions and data passing between activities.
- **Basic Android Concepts**: UI event handling, input validation, activity flow management.
